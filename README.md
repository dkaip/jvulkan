# jvulkan

**jvulkan** is a Java Vulkan SDK project.  It has been implemented in a way as to be far more 
"friendly" to programmers that grew up in the Java world.

If you are new to this you may want to also fetch the **jvulkan-examples** project.  The 
**jvulkan-examples** provides some working examples of using this project.

The fine folks at JogAmp have created Java bindings that allow you to use the Vulkan API from
Java, however, in my opinion it works fine, but, is not friendly to the Java way of doing things
and is certainly not Java programmer friendly to the normal Java programmer.

This current release is an attempt at providing access to the Vulkan Specification 1.1.101.0 
functionality ultimately via the [VulkanÂ® SDK](https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/) from LUNARG.

It is not, at this moment, complete in implementing all of the 1.1.101.0 functionality, however, it should 
be able to run all of the example programs in the **jvulkan-examples** project.  

Also, do not expect this software to work if you do not have Vulkan drivers available on your 
machine for your graphics card.  It has been running just fine on a Radeon RX460 with 4GB of RAM.

## Get the code
Use the <code>git clone</code> command to get the code. 

<code>git clone path-to-repository jvulkan</code> 

This will create a <code>jvulkan</code> directory in your current directory


## Building
Change your current directory (<code>cd</code>) to the project root directory.  If you used the 
command above it would be <code>cd jvulkan</code>.  

## Installation


In addition to this library you will need to retrieve and build the 
**jvulkan-natives-Linux-x86_64** project.

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
